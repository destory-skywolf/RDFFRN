models.common  contains the code for various key modules.

Because the dataset is too large, it has been placed in the release section. The entire dataset is composed of four files: part_aa, part_ab, part_ac, and part_ad. Readers can download these files, merge them into a zip file, and then extract it to obtain the complete dataset.

The dataset used in this study is based on preprocessed data from the Ocean Space Environment Awareness (Orca) open-source project. As the dataset is not originally created by the authors and is shared solely for the purpose of manuscript review, access to the dataset can be requested from the corresponding author.
